## Overview

*In this session you will break the program 0101-growth-loop.R into two conceptually distinct parts -- moving the code implementing how the population behaves into a function, thus separating it from the mechanics of running the simulation and plotting the results.*

## Introduction

When we look at our first program (for convenience, 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0101-growth-loop.R</span> is printed below),
there are several distinct parts to the code, despite its brevity. We first set 
the initial conditions of the simulation, then we run the simulation itself, and
finally we plot the output.

```{r plot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap = "0101-growth-loop.R", exercise.lines = 42}
#' Set up the simulation parameters
#' --------------------------------
#' First we set up the parameters for the simulation.

# Set the growth rate
growth.rate <- 0.015

# Starting population size
initial.count <- 7000000000

# And setting times
start.time <- 0
end.time <- 100

#' Run the simplest possible simulation
#' ------------------------------------
#' Then run it so that we can get the output we need

# Set up the population starting size (at the first timestep)
population.vector <- initial.count

# The timesteps that the simulation will run through
timesteps <- seq(from = start.time + 1, to = end.time)

# Now we loop through the time itself (starting at the second timestep)
for (new.time in timesteps) {
  # First extract the current population size
  current.population <- tail(population.vector, 1)
  # Calculate changes to population (births)
  new.additions <- growth.rate * current.population
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.population <- current.population + new.additions
  # Add new element onto end of population vector
  population.vector <- c(population.vector, next.population)
}

#' Plot the results
#' ----------------
#' And finally we output the results.

# Now we can plot the timesteps against the population vector
plot(c(start.time, timesteps), population.vector, type = "l")
```

Inside the simulation, we have the mechanics of iterating over the timesteps and keeping track of the results, and there is the implementation of the growth 
model itself, which occurs inside the curly brackets. Obviously in this case 
none of these four steps are very complex (and you indeed might decide there are
fewer -- or even more -- that are actually important), but as we develop more 
complex models some or all of them will become more complicated, and if they are 
all written out in one continuous piece of code it will become harder and harder 
to work out where one part ends and another begins, and how we need to change
the code if we want, for instance, to change the underlying model of population
growth, but not change the technique used for simulation or the plots produced,
in the same way as you might wish this paragraph had been broken into sentences
instead of running on seemingly for ever!

What we need to do is to introduce exactly the computing equivalent of 
punctuation and sentence/paragraph structure into the code. We introduce this 
partly by **commenting the code** well, which we have already started to do, but 
mostly by **separating out conceptually distinct parts of the code into** 
**separate functions**. This process will continue through the whole course as 
we identify 
reusable pieces of code that we can get right once, and then (hopefully) never 
have to worry about again. This often turns out to be more of an aspiration than 
reality, but nonetheless, when we do want to improve specific parts of our 
models, it is much easier to do it when the code is well structured.

## Tasks

Look at <span style="color: #dd1c77;">0101-growth-functional.R</span>. The code 
in the for loop, that is to say inside the curly brackets, describes the way 
that the population changes from one point in time to the next. This (together 
with, perhaps, the starting conditions) is what we would be changing if we 
wanted to explicitly introduce birth and death into the model, or make it a 
model of disease spread rather than population growth. The rest would remain 
pretty much the same.

We want to take this code and put it into its own function at the beginning of 
the program -- we'll call it `step_simple_growth()`. It should take 
the current population count from the vector `population.vector` and the value 
of `growth.rate` as **arguments** (function inputs), update the population 
size, and return it. This is the framework for such a function with comments 
(try to fill it in, using the for loop in 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0101-growth-loop.R</span> as a guide):

```{r stepsimplegrowth, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 20}
#' ### Function: step_simple_growth() 
#' Run one step of a simple deterministic exponential growth model. 
#'
#' Arguments: 
#' - current.population -- the population count now
#' - growth.rate -- the growth rate 
#'
#' Returns:
#' - the updated population count
#'
step_simple_growth <- function(current.population, growth.rate) {
  # Calculate changes to population
  new.additions <- ___
  # ___
  next.population <- ___
  # Return updated population
  next.population
}
```

```{r stepsimplegrowth-solution}
step_simple_growth <- function(current.population, growth.rate) {
  # Calculate changes to population
  new.additions <- growth.rate * current.population
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.population <- current.population + new.additions
  # Return updated population
  next.population
}
```

```{r stepsimplegrowth-check}
grade_this_code()
```

The `function()` command, like `for()`, has one line of code after it (comments 
are ignored) that defines what the function does. Because nearly all functions 
need multiple lines to define what they do, we nearly always use `{ ... }` 
syntax (as with `for()`) to allow us to write multiple commands all as part of 
the function definition. Remember that **whatever appears last in the function** 
**definition will be returned to the script that calls it**, in this case 
`next.population`. 

To make sure that the function is only using the information given to it in its 
arguments, we are going to use `findGlobals()` to check that it does not use any 
external information (known as **global variables**). To do 
this we load in the codetools library (you may have to install it first), and 
then call the `findGlobals()` function giving it the name of our function, as 
follows:

```{r globals-setup}
step_simple_growth <- function(current.population, growth.rate) {
  new.additions <- growth.rate * current.population
  next.population <- current.population + new.additions
  next.population
}
```

```{r globals, exercise = TRUE}
library(codetools) 
findGlobals(step_simple_growth, merge=FALSE)
```

This will return some built in functionality of R which your function uses under 
"functions", and then hopefully nothing under variables (it actually says 
`character(0)`, which is code speak for "exit success"). 

Note that the objects `new.additions` and `next.population` remain internal to 
the function `step_simple_growth()` and have no effect on the main script. 
**Objects within a function exist seperately from those in the main script and 
only exist for the length of time the function is run** (see `my_function()` 
below). We could call them `x` and `y` if we wanted to, it doesn't matter. What 
is important, is the name that we assign to the output of the function in the 
main script, which in this case (as we shall shortly see) is also 
`next.population`. This reuse of names is slightly confusing, but doesn't affect 
the running of the code. For clarity, however, we'll rename these objects later
(don't worry about them right now). 

Try playing with the following code chunk. Add a print statement inside
`my_function()`, then add a print statement after calling `my_function()` 
in the main script, and compare the value of `x`. Make sure you understand what 
is happening.

```{r inout, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 17}
# Simple function that adds 1 to an input
my_function <- function(input) {
  x <- input + 1
  x
}

# Test the function
val <- 10
my_function(val)
my_function(val * 2)

x <- 1
my_function(x)
my_function((x + 1) * 2)

new.value <- 3
my_function(input = new.value)
```

```{r inout-hint}
# Simple function that adds 1 to an input
my_function <- function(input) {
  x <- input + 1
  print(x)
  x
}

# Test the function
x <- 10
my_function(x)
print(x)
```

Having now defined the `step_simple_growth()` function, the code should proceed 
much as before but rather than have a chunk of code inside the loop we can just
assign the output of the function `step_simple_growth()` to the 
`next.population` object (replacing the first three lines of code in the `for()` 
loop with one line of code). Try it now and then run the code again, comparing 
the plotted outputs to check that your new code works exactly as the old version 
did (but structured in a better style):

```{r nextstep, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 57}
#' ### Function: step_simple_growth() 
#' Run one step of a simple deterministic exponential growth model. 
#'
#' Arguments: 
#' - current.population -- the population count now
#' - growth.rate -- the growth rate 
#'
#' Returns:
#' - the updated population count
#'
step_simple_growth <- function(current.population, growth.rate) {
  # Calculate changes to population
  new.additions <- growth.rate * current.population
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.population <- current.population + new.additions
  # Return updated population
  next.population
}

#' Set up the simulation parameters
#' --------------------------------
#' First we set up the parameters for the simulation.

# Set the growth rate
growth.rate <- 0.015

end.time <- 100

#' Run the simplest possible simulation
#' ------------------------------------
#' Then run it so that we can get the output we need

# Set up the population starting size (at the first timestep)
population.vector <- initial.count

# The timesteps that the simulation will run through
timesteps <- seq(from = start.time + 1, to = end.time)

# Now we loop through the time itself (starting at the second timestep)
for (new.time in timesteps) {
  # ___
  next.population <- ___
  # Add new element onto end of population vector
  population.vector <- c(population.vector, next.population)
}

#' Plot the results
#' ----------------
#' And finally we output the results.

# Now we can plot the timesteps against the population vector
plot(c(start.time, timesteps), population.vector, type = "l")
```

```{r nextstep-solution}
#' ### Function: step_simple_growth() 
#' Run one step of a simple deterministic exponential growth model. 
#'
#' Arguments: 
#' - current.population -- the population count now

#'
step_simple_growth <- function(current.population, growth.rate) {
  # Calculate changes to population
  new.additions <- growth.rate * current.population
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.population <- current.population + new.additions
  # Return updated population
  next.population
}

#' Set up the simulation parameters

# Now we loop through the time itself (starting at the second timestep)
for (new.time in timesteps) {
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.population <- step_simple_growth(current.population = tail(population.vector, 1), 
                                        growth.rate = growth.rate)
  # Add new element onto end of population vector
  population.vector <- c(population.vector, next.population)
}

#' Plot the results
#' ----------------
#' And finally we output the results.

# Now we can plot the timesteps against the population vector
plot(c(start.time, timesteps), population.vector, type = "l")
```

```{r nextstep-check}
grade_this_code()
```

```{r nextstep-hint}
# Within the `for()` loop where the time gets updated the code should be edited
# to contain the line and an appropriate comment:

next.population <- step_simple_growth(current.population = tail(population.vector, 1), 
                                      growth.rate = growth.rate)
```

Note that we always set arguments to functions with `argument = value`, and we
strongly recommend using `object <- value` to set variables in your main script 
to make the distinction clear. For example, `current.population` is now 
an argument of the `step_simple_growth()` function, and so you set its value 
using `=` inside the function call instead of using `<-` in the main script as 
we did on line 28 of <span style="color: #dd1c77;">0101-growth-functional.r
</span>. 

When you are happy with the code and its outputs there is another task. If you 
look at the whole code, you will see that `growth.rate` is both the name of the
argument in the function and the name of the variable in the script, and
`next.population` is used in the function and in the main script. As we said 
above, this does not affect the running of the code but can be difficult to 
read and can result in confusion when debugging for example.

Here's the latest version of the code to play with (<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0102-growth-functional.R</span>), complete with the 
`step_simple_growth()` function:

```{r laststep, exercise = TRUE, exercise.cap = "0102-growth-functional.R", exercise.lines = 58}
#' ### Function: step_simple_growth() 
#' Run one step of a simple deterministic exponential growth model. 
#'
#' Arguments: 
#' - current.population -- the population count now
#' - growth.rate -- the growth rate 
#'
#' Returns:
#' - the updated population count
#'
step_simple_growth <- function(current.population, growth.rate) {
  # Calculate changes to population
  new.additions <- growth.rate * current.population
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.population <- current.population + new.additions
  # Return updated population
  next.population
}

#' Set up the simulation parameters
#' --------------------------------
#' First we set up the parameters for the simulation.

# Set the growth rate
growth.rate <- 0.015

# Starting population size
initial.count <- 7000000000

# And setting times
start.time <- 0
end.time <- 100

#' Run the simplest possible simulation
#' ------------------------------------
#' Then run it so that we can get the output we need

# Set up the population starting size (at the first timestep)
population.vector <- initial.count

# The timesteps that the simulation will run through
timesteps <- seq(from = start.time + 1, to = end.time)

# Now we loop through the time itself (starting at the second timestep)
for (new.time in timesteps) {
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.population <- step_simple_growth(current.population = tail(population.vector, 1), 
                                        growth.rate = growth.rate)
  # Add new element onto end of population vector
  population.vector <- c(population.vector, next.population)
}

#' Plot the results
#' ----------------
#' And finally we output the results.

# Now we can plot the timesteps against the population vector
plot(c(start.time, timesteps), population.vector, type = "l")
```

Find all the instances of `growth.rate` and replace them with `my.rate` in the 
`step_simple_growth()` function (lines 11-18), then
run the code. What happens? You should get an error. It will tell you that you 
have an unused argument, `growth.rate` when you call `step_simple_growth()`. 
This is because when you call the function (lines 47-48), you set its 
`growth.rate` argument to the main script's value of `growth.rate`, but the 
function now only has an argument called `my.rate` (line 11). To fix this, we can 
change the call to `step_simple_growth()` to say `my.rate = growth.rate` (line 
48), remembering to . Now rerun the code and check it works.

Now do the same with `next.population`, replacing it **just in the function** 
with `my.population`, or something sensible, then run the code. What happens? You 
should find that the model runs exactly as before this time. This is because 
none of the names of objects being used in the function matter -- even if their
values are being returned to the main script. Object names and values are 
thrown away when the function finishes. Only the objects in the main script are 
retained. The only thing that matters is that object names are used consistently
within the function, and when you call the function in the main script. 

We need to use meaningful names to remind us what we are doing, but it can be 
confusing and cause subtle errors if we use the same variable names in many 
different places, even when they seem to refer to the same things. This is one 
of the reasons why we use `findGlobals()` to check for global variables being 
used in functions. If we never reused names in different bits of code we would 
not have to check this. For the time being (and the rest of this practical 
series), make 
sure that no argument names in the main script accidentally match names in 
functions (it's okay for variable names in different functions to match). You 
can relax this requirement in the real world, but it is best to be over-cautious 
for the time being.

For this practical, we are working with the human population in the script, so 
in the following exercises we'll change the `growth.rate` variable (in the main 
script) to `human.annual.growth`, and change `next.population` (in the main 
script) to `updated.human.population`.
