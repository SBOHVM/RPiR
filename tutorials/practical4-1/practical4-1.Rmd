## Overview

*In this session you will take some classic biodiversity data and turn it into
an R package.*

## Background

When we think about biodiversity data, we generally think about the hypothesis
we are testing, how we are going to collect the data, and how we need to analyse
it to investigate that hypothesis. Little thought is usually given to how to 
store the data. This is a mistake! Large amounts of hard work in the field can
be wasted by mistakes in storage. After regular backups so you don't physically
lose your data *(if you're not doing this, then you should stop whatever you're
doing and fix that now!)*, the next important thing to consider is whether you
are **definitely**, **always** using the most up-to-date, error-free copy of
your dataset when you carry out analyses.

If your data is stored in one or more csv files or excel spreadsheets, you need
to read that file into R. For that you need to know where it is. If you only 
have one copy of it on your computer, and you update that when you clean the 
data or add new records, then that is a single point of failure. If you
accidentally make incorrect edits or delete the file, then you are entirely 
dependent on backups to recover from your mistakes (assuming you followed the
instructions above and have a backup!).

If, on the other hand, you create a new file every time you update the data, 
then all of your R scripts that do analyses on the data now have to refer to the
new file, or you will need to copy the new data file to the projects where you
are doing the analysis. If you don't do either of these everywhere you are 
working on the data, one or more of your analyses may be using an out of date 
version of the data, and silently give incorrect answers.

Even if your behaviour is perfect, and you never make mistakes with your data,
then it is usually necessary to do some processing to the data before carrying 
out the analyses. This may be as simple as changing some of the column names in 
your tables so they are easier to work with in R (no spaces, for instance), some
cleaning of the data to remove missing data, or some significant processing to 
turn records that are easy to collect into data that is easy to analyse. Such a
script, just like the data, needs to be updated, and the code needs to be 
present wherever you carry out an analysis. It therefore suffers from exactly 
the same problems as the data itself.

There is a simple(-ish!) solution though. You don't need to carry around your 
own copy of `ggplot()` or `lmer()` in every script you write, so why should you 
have to do it with the data? There is one definitive version of `ggplot()` and 
`lmer()` on your computer, and you just refer to them by loading the `ggplot2` 
and `lme4` packages using the `library()` function. When these packages get 
updated to fix bugs or extend functionality, you just do it once by installing
(normally updating) the R package, and then all of your scripts use the new 
version. So why not turn your data into an R package and do the same?

You'll go through the process of creating a package, processing data, inserting
the data into the package, and building the package so that you can use it
during the project work at the end of the course.

## Tasks: storing the data

First, create a new package called `githubusernameBCI` (replacing
`githubusername` with your actual GitHub username) as a git repository
connected to GitHub as a repo in the `IBAHCM` organisation. Remember that
a guide to creating packages on GitHub is available on the `RPiR` help pages
[here](https://ibahcm.github.io/RPiR/articles/pages/packages_guide.html) if
you're not sure what to do.

Generally, you would want to store the raw data from your work in the git
repository so everything is archived and version controlled on GitHub. However,
in this work, the dataset is not yours, and it's so big it easily exceeds file
limits for storage in GitHub. So, **under no circumstances** commit the raw
records to your git repository -- it's far too big. We'll show you how to ignore
it so that you don't do this by mistake shortly, but just bear this in mind now
so you ensure that you don't -- the moment you commit a file like this into a
repo it's hard to undo the error.

Next, you need to download the Barro Colorado Forest Census Plot Data from the 
Smithsonian's repository at https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/20925. 
Download files 3 and 4, the full census data 
(<span style="color: #dd1c77;">ViewFullTable.zip</span>) and the taxonomic data 
on all of the species present 
(<span style="color: #dd1c77;">ViewTax.txt</span>). Now create a folder to
store these raw data in, and create the files you will use shortly to process
the data:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_data_raw("bci_2010")
usethis::use_data_raw("bci_quadrats")
usethis::use_data_raw("bci_taxa")
```

Copy the files you have downloaded to the
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">data-raw</span> folder that has just been created
inside the R package, and unzip the
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">ViewFullTable.zip</span> file into the same
folder. You can now delete the zip file if you like. Now we need to make sure
that none of these files make it into your git repo by accident. Run:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
usethis::edit_git_ignore("project")
```

And add the following lines to the end of the
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">.gitignore</span> file that has opened:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
ViewTax.txt
ViewFullTable.zip
ViewFullTable
TSMAttributes.txt
ViewFullTable.txt
ViewFullTable.pdf
```

Now go to the git pane in RStudio, and make sure that the none of the files you
just downloaded show up in the pane. Commit everything and create a suitable
commit message for these initial files. Now create a new R file in the
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">data-raw</span> folder. This will be the file you
run to put all of the data into the package. It should contain the following:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
# Put the datasets into the package
library(dplyr)

# Move to the data-raw subfolder to access the raw data
devtools::wd(".", "data-raw")

# BCI data

# Load individual BCI records
data <- read.delim(file.path("ViewFullTable", "ViewFullTable.txt"))

# Load BCI taxonomic data, create new species column, and extract species
taxa <- read.delim("ViewTax.txt") %>%
  mutate(GenusSpecies = as.factor(paste(Genus, SpeciesName))) %>%
  filter(IDLevel == "species")

# Store species counts from 2010 census in package
source("bci_2010.R")

# Store quadrat metadata in package
source("bci_quadrats.R")

# Store taxonomic data in package
source("bci_taxa.R")
```

This will load all of the raw data into R (this will take some time) and run the
files you have created to process each of them and store them in the package.
**Don't do this yet! First, you need to edit the processing files (bci_2010.R,
bci_quadrats.R and bci_taxa.R) to do the processing correctly.** Actually, we 
provide them for you here!

This is <span style="color: #dd1c77;">bci_2010.R</span>:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

# Clean data to remove secondary and dead stems of trees and species not in
# taxonomy
records <- data %>%
  filter(PrimaryStem == "main", Status == "alive", !is.na(QuadratName)) %>%
  filter(GenusSpecies %in% taxa$GenusSpecies) %>%
  select(GenusSpecies, PlotCensusNumber, QuadratName) %>%
  mutate(col = as.integer(floor(QuadratName / 100)),
         row = as.integer(QuadratName - col * 100)) %>%
  filter(row < 25)

# Extract table at a single timepoint
bci_2010 <- records %>% filter(PlotCensusNumber == 7) %>%
  select(GenusSpecies, QuadratName) %>%
  acast(GenusSpecies ~ QuadratName, fill = 0,
        value.var = "QuadratName", fun.aggregate = length)

# Call columns Q.xxyy, and store package
colnames(bci_2010) <- sprintf("Q.%04d", as.integer(colnames(bci_2010)))

# Store in package
usethis::use_data(bci_2010, overwrite = TRUE)
```

It takes the massive Barro Colorado Island (BCI) dataset and extracts only the
2010 (7th) census and summarises it to extract a matrix of counts of known
species of living trees in 20m x 20m quadrats across the site.

This is <span style="color: #dd1c77;">bci_quadrats.R</span>:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

# Work out useful information about the quadrats themselves
# Note: they index from 0 and they are 20m x 20m quadrats
bci_quadrats <- records %>% select(QuadratName, row, col) %>%
  unique %>%
  mutate(x = row * 20, y = col * 20, row = row + 1, col = col + 1) %>%
  mutate(Quadrat = sprintf("Q.%04d", as.integer(QuadratName))) %>%
  arrange(Quadrat) %>%
  as_tibble

# Store in package
usethis::use_data(bci_quadrats, overwrite = TRUE)
```

It provides metadata about the quadrats -- where they are within the site -- as
a tibble (a prettier version of a data frame that the RStudio team have created).

Finally, this is <span style="color: #dd1c77;">bci_taxa.R</span>:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

# Discard species not identified to species level
bci_taxa <- taxa %>% filter(IDLevel == "species") %>%
  select(GenusSpecies, Genus, Family) %>%
  filter(GenusSpecies %in% rownames(bci_2010)) %>%
  unique %>% as_tibble

# Store in package
usethis::use_data(bci_taxa, overwrite = TRUE)
```

This will turn the huge data frame containing all of the taxonomic records of
the site into a tibble called `bci_taxa`, which just contains the species name
(`GenusSpecies`), genus (`Genus`) and family (`Family`) of each living tree
species on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and stores it in the package.

Finally you need to do three things:

1. Commit all of the scripts that you have just created
2. Run the script that you created to generate the data files and commit them
3. Add in all of the packages you are using as dependencies of this package

If you have a problem in step 2, with an error about a file missing here:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
data <- read.delim(file.path("ViewFullTable", "ViewFullTable.txt"))
```

Then your computer may have unzipped files differently from mine -- mine has
created a folder in <span style="color: #dd1c77;">data-raw</span>
called <span style="color: #dd1c77;">ViewFullTable</span>, but yours may have
just unzipped the files directly into data-raw. In that case, just change the
line to:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
data <- read.delim("ViewFullTable.txt")
```

Step 3 is (hopefully!) easy, and it is something you are going to have to keep
up to date as you develop any package -- you need to check which libraries you
load using `library(xxx)` in any script or demo, and which libraries you use by
qualifying function calls with `xxx::function_name()`. You then need to run:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_package("xxx")
```

to add the `xxx` package to those *imported* by your package in the
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">DESCRIPTION</span> file. See
[here](https://ibahcm.github.io/RPiR/articles/pages/packages_guide.html#add-dependencies)
for further details. Commit these changes to the repo too, and push them to
GitHub. **Note that you should not add your own (`githubusernameBCI`) package to
the package dependencies of `githubusernameBCI`, because it is not a dependency
of itself! If you have accidentally done this you need to go into the
`DESCRIPTION` file and delete it from the `Imports:` entry there.**

Finally, if you are going to add a package on GitHub to your dependencies (such
as our `RPiR` package), you need to use `usethis::use_dev_package()` instead of
`usethis::use_package()`. You need to know where to find it on GitHub, and then
use:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_dev_package("RPiR", remote = "IBAHCM/RPiR")
```

where the `remote` argument is the organisation and repo name. In the project,
when you are using your own data package in your new project package,
you will need to do this by calling something like
`usethis::use_dev_package("githubusernameBCI", remote = "IBAHCM/githubusernameBCI")`.

## Tasks: documenting the package

First you need to edit the <span style="color: #dd1c77;">DESCRIPTION</span> file
(more [here](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html) so that it contains the right
information about you and the package, and you need to create a documentation
file for the package in the <span style="color: #dd1c77;">R</span> folder so
that `?githubusernameBCI` returns a description. You had this in the package for the third
practical series, but you'll see details on how to do that 
[here](https://ibahcm.github.io/RPiR/articles/pages/packages_guide.html#package-documentation).

Create a new file in the <span style="color: #dd1c77;">R</span> 
folder -- I'm going to call it <span style="color: #dd1c77;">githubusernameBCI-package.R</span> 
because the convention is packagename-package.R. Then describe your package
(most easily lifted from the <span style="color: #dd1c77;">DESCRIPTION</span> file):

```{r eval = FALSE}
#' Barro Colorado Island data package 
#'
#' Package to hold the BCI data (or whatever) -- maybe also mention something
#' about these functions now, and put that in the DESCRIPTION too. And then
#' put it in the README.md file. And don't forget to reference the source of
#' the data correctly.
#'
#' @import magrittr 
#'
#' @name githubusernameBCI-package
#' @aliases githubusernameBCI
#' @docType package 
#'
NULL
```

There are a few things going on here that you should notice for making packages 
in the future. The first is that you need to say what your package is called -- 
here I have given it two names `githubusernameBCI-package` and an alias of just
`githubusernameBCI`, which you do with the `@aliases` command. Secondly, the
`NULL` at the end of the file is included when there is no object associated
with this documentation, which is the case here, since this file contains the
package documentation, as defined explicitly in the `@docType` tag (more info
[here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html#man-packages)). Finally, if you are
using any packages in any of your functions, you may want to import them into
your package here. This is done using `@import` -- see more
[here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html). You can then put the same, or a
similar, package description into the
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">README.md</span> file in the package so that 
people going to GitHub will see what the package that you have created does 
without having to install it. Note that GitHub README pages use a special type 
of markdown called Git Flavored Markdown; more information can be found here https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github with 
more general documentation here 
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/. Note that with markdown
you don't need to start lines with `#'`.

Second, you need to document the data that you are providing in this package,
by creating file(s) in the <span style="color: #dd1c77;">R</span> folder again.
You'll find details on how to create the documentation
[here](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html), or an abbreviated version in our guide
[here](https://ibahcm.github.io/RPiR/articles/pages/packages_guide.html#add-data).

Finally, build the documentation (using `devtools::document()`), and commit all
of the changes to git.

Make sure throughout the documentation that you credit the real source of the
data as the [Smithsonian](https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/20925).

## Running the code

Now you should have a working R data package. Try installing it (using
`devtools::install()`), restarting R and loading it. Check that the objects you
have created exist -- you should be able to see them in the 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">Environment</span> pane, but more simply by just 
typing:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
library(githubusernameBCI)
bci_taxa
bci_quadrats
bci_2010
```

You should (hopefully!) find that all of the objects exist, though you may be
surprised to find that they appear to be normal data frames instead of tibbles.
This actually isn't true, and if you run:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
library(githubusernameBCI)
library(tibble)
bci_taxa
bci_quadrats
```

You'll see that they are tibbles. Tibbles automatically fall back to being
data frames if you don't load the library.


## Sharing is caring

Now give your subgroup partners access to the repo, and get them to install
your package using `devtools::install_github("IBAHCM/githubusernameBCI")` (or
cloning the package and installing it directly if need be) and check it works.
