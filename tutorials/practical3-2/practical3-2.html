<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Practical 3-2: First stochastic birth-death
model</h1>

</div>


<div id="section-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><em>In this practical we will run our first stochastic simulations,
starting with the stochastic version of the birth-death model. From now
on, we will expect a brief report in some format on every practical, so
we will not give explicit guidance in every case.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="section-background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the lecture, we discussed the fact that the <strong>deterministic
models</strong> we have been using so far don’t handle dynamics at the
individual level well. To capture individual-level behaviour we need to
include an element of chance in the model. This new type of model, which
includes a probabilistic element, is called a <strong>stochastic
model</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-tasks" class="section level2">
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>To write a model to handle stochastic population dynamics we
obviously have to update the timestep function to handle the new
dynamics. However, we also have to understand whether anything else has
changed in how the simulation works. In fact, something has. There is
now the chance that the population will die out before the end of the
experiment, so we need to look for this happening – not least to speed
up the simulation.</p>
<div id="section-write-a-demo" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Write a demo</h3>
<p>We’ll start by writing the structural code in a new demo file. In
Practical 3-1 we created this file and named it <span
style="color: #dd1c77;">demo/d0302_stochastic_birth_death.R</span>.
Currently, the demo is a copy of the <span
style="color: #dd1c77;">d0105_run_birth_death</span> demo, which is a
good starting point. In this Practical you will edit this code.</p>
<p>From Practicals 2-3 and 2-4 we have a <code>while()</code> loop which
runs the simulation, <em>e.g.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>while (latest.population$time &lt; end.time) {
  latest.population &lt;- timestep_deterministic_SIS(latest, 
                                                  ecoli.transmission, 
                                                  ecoli.recovery, 
                                                  timestep)
  population.df &lt;- rbind(population.df, latest.population)
}</code></pre>
<p>The loop ends when the time runs out. Now, instead, there are two
reasons why we might stop the simulation – the time may have run out, or
the timestep code may identify that the dynamics are now complete. To
achieve this, the timestep code will have to return both the updated
population and whether the simulation is over. We suggest doing
something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>while (keep.going) {
  data &lt;- timestep_stochastic_birth_death(latest, 
                                          human.annual.birth, 
                                          human.annual.death, 
                                          timestep)
  latest.population &lt;- data$updated.pop
  population.df &lt;- rbind(population.df, latest.population)
  # The experiment may end stochastically or the time may run out 
  keep.going &lt;- (!data$end.experiment) &amp;&amp; (latest.population$time &lt; end.time)
}</code></pre>
<p>We’re going to have to change the function
<code>timestep_stochastic_birth_death</code> shortly so it returns this
additional information.</p>
<p>Notice also that at the start of the loop <code>keep.going</code> has
not yet been defined, which will cause an error, so you will need to
start it off with an appropriate value.</p>
<p>Remember that <code>library(RPiR)</code> at the top of the script
loads <code>plot_populations()</code>, and
<code>library(githubusernameSeries03)</code> loads
<code>timestep_stochastic_birth_death()</code>, which means you no
longer need to source any helper files.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-write-a-function" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Write a function</h3>
<p>You will need to write the
<code>timestep_stochastic_birth_death()</code> function to provide the
right information to the main loop. We created this file in Practical
3-1, but the function itself contains the deterministic step function
for single species population dynamics,
<code>step_deterministic_birth_death()</code> (from Practical 1-5). This
is a useful starting point. Starting with this code, you need to make
three changes.</p>
<p>First, we need to handle the effect of changing timesteps and update
the code with something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>timestep_stochastic_birth_death &lt;- function(latest, 
                                            birth.rate, 
                                            death.rate, 
                                            timestep) {
  # Multiply birth and death rates by timestep
  effective.birth.rate &lt;- birth.rate * timestep
  effective.death.rate &lt;- ____ * ____
  
  # Determine the numbers of new births and deaths
  
  
  # Store new time and count in a dataframe
  next.population &lt;- data.frame(time = latest$time + timestep, 
                                ____ = ____)
  
  # Determine whether the experiment is finished
  
  
  # Return both of these pieces of information
  
  
}</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to make the simulation stochastic using
<code>rbinom()</code>. Remember, if you want to draw once from the
binomial distribution with <code>count</code> trials, and a probability
of success of <code>prob</code>, then the number of successes is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new.events &lt;- rbinom(1, count, prob)</code></pre>
<p>So, the key is to use the <code>rbinom()</code> function to determine
the numbers of new births and deaths in each time step. The number of
births is drawn from a binomial distribution with size
<code>count</code> and probability <code>birth.rate * timestep</code>,
and the number of deaths is drawn from the same distribution with
probability <code>death.rate * timestep</code>.</p>
<p>We then store the next timestep and next count values in a
dataframe.</p>
<p>Then we need to determine whether the experiment is finished. In this
case, the experiment will only end if the population completely dies
out, so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>is.finished &lt;- (____ == 0)</code></pre>
<p>You just need to work out what the blank should be…</p>
<p>Finally, we need to return both the updated population and simulation
state (whether the simulation has ended) from the function. Since a
function can only return one item, we will have to return a list with
two elements at the end of the function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>list(updated.pop = next.population, end.experiment = is.finished) </code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Note that the <code>rbinom()</code> function is in the
<code>stats</code> library, so you could perhaps more correctly call it
as <code>stats::rbinom(1, count, prob)</code>, and then add the stats
library to your package’s dependencies by typing
<code>usethis::use_package("stats")</code> in the console (this will
update the <span style="color: #dd1c77;">DESCRIPTION</span> file).
Finally in the <span
style="color: #dd1c77;">R/githubusernameSeries03-package.R</span> file,
you need to import the functions from this library, as you already have
for <code>RPiR</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; @import RPiR
#&#39; @import stats</code></pre>
<p>Doing this is not strictly necessary since <code>stats</code> is a
core built-in R library, but it will be necessary if you use any
functions from other libraries in later exercises. We described this for
<code>RPiR</code> in Practical 3-1 in the <em>Package metadata and
dependencies</em> section.</p>
<p>You can determine what library a new function you use is in if you’re
not sure by looking at the top left hand corner of the help file for the
function – here it says <em>Binomial {stats}</em>, the library name is
in curly brackets. If it says <em>{base}</em>, that means it really is
built in to R and doesn’t need qualifying like this.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with your function, run
<code>devtools::document()</code> to generate <span
style="color: #dd1c77;">man/</span> files and edit the <span
style="color: #dd1c77;">NAMESPACE</span>. Then run
<code>devtools::install()</code> to permanently install it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-report" class="section level2">
<h2>Report</h2>
<p>When you are happy that the code is working and makes sense, start
working on your report (in your <span
style="color: #dd1c77;">demo/d0302_stochastic_birth_death.R</span> demo
file). Remember that you can run your code by</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>compiling a notebook, or by</li>
<li>running it as a demo</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>demo(&quot;d0302_stochastic_birth_death&quot;, package = &quot;githubusernameSeries03&quot;)</code></pre>
<div id="section-demonstrate-stochasticity" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Demonstrate stochasticity</h3>
<p>Run the code several times with a birth rate of 0.2, a death rate of
0.1, an initial population count of 1, and a timestep of 1. Since we’re
repeating the piece of code doing the simulation, you could do this
using a <code>for</code> loop. The stochasticity means that we see
variable outputs. This is most easily demonstrated if you plot multiple
results in the same figure, which you can do with an <code>if</code>
statement. You should get something like this:</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/3-2.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">plot</p>
</div>
</center>
</div>
<div id="section-increase-variability" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Increase variability</h3>
<p>Increase birth and death rates or the time you’re simulating over to
increase visible variability. Again, you could use a <code>for</code>
loop to generate outputs over a range of different rates / time
periods.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-increase-timestep" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Increase timestep</h3>
<p>If you haven’t already, try increasing the value of timestep. What
happens? You are actually getting impossible numbers (<code>NA</code>s)
because the probability of giving birth has got above 1. You can fix
this by using the <code>stop()</code> command inside your
<code>timestep_stochastic_birth_death()</code> function to stop running
code when the numbers you put in are impossible:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if ((effective.birth.rate &gt;= 1) || (effective.death.rate &gt;= 1))
  stop(&quot;Effective rate too high, timestep must be too big&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Remember that for this <code>stop()</code> command to be effective
you have to put the test <em>after</em> you define the variables you are
checking, but <em>before</em> you use them! Rerun the code and check it
stops when appropriate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-check-it-works" class="section level2">
<h2>Check it works</h2>
<p>As with previous exercises, you need to check that everything works
correctly – that the package installs, and the demos and help files work
and you can generate reports from the demos – and then we want you to
get a couple of other people in your subgroup to check your code and
make sure it works for them, and we want you to check other people’s
code too. We describe how to do this for packages in GitHub in Practical
3-1 (also under <em>Check it works</em>) if you’re uncertain.</p>
<p><em>Remember, interacting like this through GitHub to help each other
will count as most of your engagement marks for the course.</em>
