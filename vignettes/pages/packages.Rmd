# Some reassurance!

First, here are some talks about how easy this is from rstudio::global 2021:

- [Make a package - Make some friends][rstudioglobal2021-package]
- [You're Already Ready: Zen and the Art of R Package Development][rstudioglobal2021-repro-pkg]

# Creating an R Package

You'll find a guide on how to create an R package linked to GitHub in RStudio
in [a guide on this website](https://ibahcm.github.io/RPiR/articles/pages/packages_guide.html).

# Other reference material

The [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org) book is a good resource covering all 
aspects of writing packages in R.

During this course, we recommend using tools in RStudio and the `usethis`
package for easy package development. In doing so, a standard package structure
is automatically generated for you. Here are some links that might be useful:

* <span style="color: #de77ae;">.gitignore</span>: contains regular
expressions that should be ignored by Git, more info
[here](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-gitignore-file)
* <span style="color: #de77ae;">.Rbuildignore</span>: contains regular
expressions that should be ignored by R CMD check / when building the package 
from source, more info
[here](https://r-pkgs.org/package-structure-state.html#rbuildignore)
* <span style="color: #de77ae;">demo/</span>: contains R demo files, more info
[here](https://r-pkgs.org/misc.html#demo) (which we've populated with 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">d0105_run_birth_death.R</span>, the
script from Practical 1-5)
* <span style="color: #de77ae;">DESCRIPTION</span>: contains metadata about 
your package, more info [here](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html)
* <span style="color: #de77ae;">man/</span>: contains code used to generate 
documentation when the package is built (don't edit these files, this process 
will be automated), more info [here](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-workflow)
* <span style="color: #de77ae;">NAMESPACE</span>: contains the names of 
imported and exported functions (don't edit this file either), more info
[here](https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html#namespace)
* <span style="color: #de77ae;">R/</span>: contains code used to generate 
functions when the package is built (which we've populated with 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">step_deterministic_birth_death.R</span>, the step function from
Practical 1-5), more info [here](https://r-pkgs.org/r.html#code-organising)
* <span style="color: #de77ae;">README.md</span>: contains markdown used to 
generate your GitHub repository readme page, more info 
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes)
* <span style="color: #de77ae;">githubusername.Rproj</span>: an RStudio project 
file, which is used to make this directory an RStudio project, and can be used 
as a shortcut for opening this project from your filesystem, more info 
[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)
