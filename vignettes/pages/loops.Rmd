Loops allow you to repeat the same thing again and again. If you are doing
something more than two or three times, you should instead use a loop to
avoid having to copy and paste the same code over and over again.
Since duplicating code risks not only mistyping or not copying correctly, but
also of creating confusion by filling your R scripts with nearly identical 
chunks of code. There are fundamentally two kinds of loop:

- one where you know exactly how many times the loop will run, for instance 
  because you're running a chunk of code once for each element of a vector or
  row or column of a data frame; and
- one where you do not, because some part of your calculation in each step of
  the loop will determine whether to continue or to stop.

# `for (...)` loops

`for` loops allow us to repeat something *for* a fixed number of times (*e.g.*
once per element of a vector, once per row of a data frame, *etc.*). 


They are called as:

```{R}
greetings <- c("Hello", "Goodbye")
for (word in greetings) {
  # body
}
```

and after each run through the loop, the variable (here `word`) is updated with
the next element (here, in the vector `greetings`). We introduced for loops in 
week 1 and again in [Lecture 5b][lecture-5b] and Practical
`practicalA-1`. They were then used from Practical `practical1-1` onwards.

There is a section in R4DS (within a more general chapter on
[*Iteration*][R4DS-iteration]) that covers [`for` loops][for-R4DS]. For loops
are also covered by R Coder [here][for-rcoder].

# `while (...)` loops

`while` loops allows us to repeat something *while* a condition is still `TRUE`.
They are particularly useful when you don't know in advance exactly how many
times something will be done, but can be used in any situation. Unlike `for`
loops though, you need to update everything manually each time around:


```{R, eval=FALSE}
test <- some_test()
while (test) {
  # Do something
  test <- update(something)
}
```

`test` is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and as long as `test` 
continues to be
`TRUE`, the code block inside the curly brackets `{ ... }` is run. Be careful...
if you don't update `test` inside the curly brackets, your loop will continue 
forever! However, if (when!) `test` is finally `FALSE`, the loop will end and R
will continue on to the next line of code after the loop.

We introduced them in [Lecture 6a][lecture-6a],
and used them from Practical `practical2-4` onwards. There is a
section in R4DS (within a more general chapter on [*Iteration*][R4DS-iteration])
that covers [`while` loops][while-R4DS]. While loops are also covered by R Coder
[here][while-rcoder].
