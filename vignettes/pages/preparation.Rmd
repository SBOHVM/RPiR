## Checking that R and RStudio are up to date

You'll need to do a few things before we can start the course. First you need to
check you have up-to-date versions of R and RStudio. This means that R should be
at least version 4. You can check by typing this in R:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
version$major >= 4
```

If this is `FALSE`, download and install a new version from
https://www.r-project.org. Next install these packages:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c('devtools', 'rstudioapi', 'rdiversity', 'vegan', 'iNEXT'))
```

Then check whether RStudio is up to date:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
# Load the rstudioapi library and check RStudio version
library(rstudioapi)
isAvailable("1.4")

# or just
rstudioapi::isAvailable("1.4")
```
**NB `rstudioapi::xxx()` means *"find the `xxx()` function in the `rstudioapi` package"*.**

If `FALSE`, download and install the latest version of [RStudio Desktop][rstudio]
and check this has worked by running the above again.

Next, check you are now ready to build R packages:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
# Load the devtools library and check whether compilers are installed
library(devtools)
has_devel()

# or just
devtools::has_devel()
```

If this is `FALSE` or errors, then you will need to follow instructions given
by the function or ask for help until this works.

## Creating accounts and installation

Once all of the above works, you're ready to start, so follow the details under
the `Installation` dropdown menu [in the documentation for this package][docs].
Specifically:

1. First [create an account on GitHub and connect it to RStudio][github]. This will
   also show you how to create a practice project on github. You'll use this in
   the second practical series, but it's worth trying out the instructions now
   to check that everything is working.
2. Then [install the RPiR package][package].

## Stopping warnings

Finally, you will probably find that some warnings are being generated when you
load the package. This is a known issue in another package that we can't
currently fix. To stop them, you need to type this in the console:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_profile(scope = "user")
```

And add this to the file that is opened:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
options(yaml.eval.expr = TRUE)
```

If you restart R, you should then find that the warnings have been removed.
