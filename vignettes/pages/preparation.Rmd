*Check that R and RStudio are up to date*

You'll need to do a few things before we can start the course. First you need to
check you have up-to-date versions of R and RStudio. This means that R should be
at least version 4. You can check by typing this in R:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
version$major >= 4
```

If this is `FALSE`, download and install a new version from
https://www.r-project.org. Then install these packages:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c('devtools', 'rstudioapi', 'rdiversity', 'vegan', 'iNEXT'))
```

If you find yourself stuck in a loop of asking you to restart R, then it's okay
to say no.

If you have trouble getting vegan to install and you're on a Mac, then you
should go to [this site](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases)
and download the correct version of `gfortran` depending on your computer and
install it. Then restart R and try again!

Then check whether RStudio is up to date:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
# Load the rstudioapi library and check RStudio version
library(rstudioapi)
isAvailable("1.4")

# which is equivalent to
rstudioapi::isAvailable("1.4")
```

> Note that `rstudioapi::xxx()` means *"find the `xxx()` function in the `rstudioapi` package"*.

If `FALSE`, download and install the latest version of [RStudio Desktop][rstudio]
and check this has worked by running the above again.

Next, check you are now ready to build R packages:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
# Load the devtools library and check whether compilers are installed
library(devtools)
has_devel()

# which is equivalent to
devtools::has_devel()
```

If this is `FALSE` or errors, then you will need to follow instructions given
by the function or ask for help until this works.
