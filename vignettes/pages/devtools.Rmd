# When to `devtools::document()`?

You should call `devtools::document()` when you: 

1. Edit a function's documentation block (this edits a file in the *man* directory)

    ```
    #' title
    #' 
    #' @param argument description
    ```
2. Write a new function with a documentation block (this generates a file in the *man* directory)

> **Note that**: when you call `?function` the help file is generated from the files in the *man* directory, but only when the changes are installed and loaded into R.

3. Edit the *packagename-package.R* file (this generates the package documentation, called via `?packagename` after installing and loading it into R)
4. Write a new function (this will add the name of your function to the *NAMESPACE* file)

> **Note that**: the *NAMESPACE* file lists the functions that will be included in your package on install as well as any external package dependencies.

5. Change the name of a function (this will replace the name of your function in the *NAMESPACE* file)

# When to `devtools::install()`?

`devtools::install` will install all changes to your package (edits to functions, edits to demos, changes to *NAMESPACE*, and files in the *man* directory) to your instance of R.

# When to `library()`?

`library()` will load the version of the package currently installed in your instance of R (it doesn't matter whether you've installed it via `devtools::install`, `devtools::install_github()`, or `install.packages()`) .
