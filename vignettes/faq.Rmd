## How to use this package

### Run a practical

You first need to load up the learnr package, then use `run_tutorial()` and select the practical you wish to run: 

```{r, eval = F}
library(learnr)
run_tutorial("practical1-1", package = "RPiR")
```

From Practical exercise 1-6 onwards, we suggest that you open a separate instance of RStudio to run your code.

### Reset a practical

Click on the Start Over link (look for the tiny grey text below the left menu). 

### Close a practical

Close the window, then click on the red STOP button in RStudio to end the process.
