## Overview

*In this practical we will run our first stochastic simulations, starting with
the stochastic version of the birth-death model. From now on, we will
expect a brief report in some format on every practical, so we will not give
explicit guidance in every case.*

## Background

In the lecture, we discussed the fact that the **deterministic models** we have
been using so far don't handle dynamics at the individual level well. To 
capture individual-level behaviour we need to include an element of chance in
the model. This new type of model, which includes a probabilistic element, is 
called a **stochastic model**.

## Tasks

To write a model to handle stochastic population dynamics we obviously have to 
update the timestep function to handle the new dynamics. However, we also have 
to understand whether anything else has changed in how the simulation works. In
fact, something has. There is now the chance that the population will die out
before the end of the experiment, so we need to look for this happening -- not 
least to speed up the simulation.

### 1. Write a demo

We'll start by writing the structural code in a new demo file. In Practical 3-1
we created this file and named it <span style="color: #de77ae;">demo/d0302_stochastic_birth_death.R</span>. Currently, the demo
is a copy of the <span style="color: #de77ae;">d0105_run_birth_death</span> 
demo, which is a good starting point. In this Practical you will edit this code.

From Practicals 2-4 and 2-5 we have a `while()` loop which runs the simulation,
*e.g.*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
while (latest.population$time < end.time) {
  latest.population <- timestep_deterministic_SIR(latest, 
                                                  transmission.rate, 
                                                  recovery.rate, 
                                                  timestep)
  population.df <- rbind(population.df, latest.population)
}
```

The loop ends when the time runs out. Now, instead, there are two reasons why we
might stop the simulation -- the time may have run out, or the timestep code may
identify that the dynamics are now complete. To achieve this, the timestep code 
will have to return both the updated population and whether the simulation is
over. We suggest doing something like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
while (keep.going) {
  data <- timestep_stochastic_birth_death(latest, 
                                          transmission.rate, 
                                          recovery.rate, 
                                          timestep) 
  latest.population <- data$updated.pop
  population.df <- rbind(population.df, latest.population)
  # The experiment may end stochastically or the time may run out 
  keep.going <- (!data$end.experiment) && (latest.population$time < end.time)
}
```

We're going to have to change the function `timestep_stochastic_birth_death`
shortly so it returns this additional information.

Notice also that at the start of the loop `keep.going` has not yet been defined, 
which will cause an error, so you will need to start it off with an appropriate
value. 

Remember that `library(RPiR)` at the top of the script loads
`plot_populations()`, and `library(githubusernameSeries03)` loads
`timestep_stochastic_birth_death()`, which means you 
no longer need to source any helper files.

### 2. Write a function

You will need to write the `timestep_stochastic_birth_death()` 
function to provide the right information to the main loop. We created this 
file in Practical 3-1, but the function itself contains the deterministic step 
function for single species population dynamics,
`step_deterministic_birth_death()` (from Practical 1-5). This is a useful 
starting point. Starting with this code, you need to make three changes. 

First, we need to handle the effect of changing timesteps and update
the code with something like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
timestep_stochastic_birth_death <- function(latest, 
                                            birth.rate, 
                                            death.rate, 
                                            timestep) {
  # Multiply birth and death rates by timestep
  effective.birth.rate <- birth.rate * timestep
  effective.death.rate <- ____ * ____
  
  # Determine the numbers of new births and deaths
  
  
  # Store new time and count in a dataframe
  next.population <- data.frame(time = latest$time + timestep, 
                                ____ = ____)
  
  # Determine whether the experiment is finished
  
  
  # Return both of these pieces of information
  
  
}
```

Then we need to make the simulation stochastic using `rbinom()`. Remember, 
if you want to draw once from the binomial distribution with `count` trials, and 
a probability of success of `prob`, then the number of successes is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new.events <- rbinom(1, count, prob)
```

So, the key is to use the `rbinom()` function to determine the numbers of new 
births and deaths in each time step. The number of births is drawn from a 
binomial distribution with size `count` and probability `birth.rate * timestep`, 
and the number of deaths is drawn from the same distribution with probability 
`death.rate * timestep`.

We then store the next timestep and next count values in a dataframe.

Then we need to determine whether the experiment is finished. In this case, the 
experiment will only end if the population completely dies out, so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
is.finished <- (the.number.of.individuals.left == 0)
```

You just need to work out what `the.number.of.individuals.left` should be...

Finally, we need to return both the updated population and simulation state
(whether the simulation has ended) from the function. Since a
function can only return one item, we will have to return a list with two
elements at the end of the function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list(updated.pop = next.population, end.experiment = is.finished) 
```

***

Note that the `rbinom()` function is in the `stats` library, so you could
perhaps more correctly call it as `stats::rbinom(1, count, prob)`, and then add
the stats library to your package's dependencies by typing
`usethis::use_package("stats")` in the console (this will update the
<span style="color: #de77ae;">DESCRIPTION</span> file). Finally in the 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">R/githubusernameSeries03-package.R</span> file,
you need to import the functions from this library, as you already have for
`RPiR`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#' @import RPiR
#' @import stats
```

Doing this is not strictly necessary since `stats` is a core built-in R library,
but it will be necessary if you use any functions from other libraries in later
exercises. We described this for `RPiR` in Practical 3-1 in the *Package
metadata and dependencies* section.

You can determine what library a new function you use is in if you're not sure
by looking at the top left hand corner of the help file for the function -- here
it says *Binomial {stats}*, the library name is in curly brackets. If it says
*{base}*, that means it really is built in to R and doesn't need qualifying like
this.

Once you're happy with your function, run `devtools::document()` to generate
<span style="color: #de77ae;">man/</span> files and edit the 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">NAMESPACE</span>. Then run `devtools::install()`
to permanently install it.

## Report

When you are happy that the code is working and makes sense, start working on
your report (in your
<span style="color: #de77ae;">demo/d0302_stochastic_birth_death.R</span> demo 
file). Remember that you can run your code by 

1. compiling a notebook, or by 
2. running it as a demo

```{r eval = FALSE}
demo("d0302_stochastic_birth_death", package = "githubusername")
```

### 1. Demonstrate stochasticity

Run the code several times with a birth rate of 0.2, a death rate of 0.1, an 
initial population count of 1, and a timestep of 1. Since we're repeating the 
piece of code doing the simulation, you could do this using a `for` loop. The 
stochasticity means that we see variable outputs. This is most easily 
demonstrated if you plot multiple results in the same figure, which you
can do with an `if` statement. You should get something like this:

<center>![plot](images/3-2.png)</center>

### 2. Increase variability

Increase birth and death rates or the time you're simulating over to
increase visible variability. Again, you could use a `for` loop to generate
outputs over a range of different rates / time periods.

### 3. Increase timestep

If you haven't already, try increasing the value of timestep. What happens? You
are actually getting impossible numbers (`NA`s) because the probability of
giving birth has got above 1. You can fix this by using the `stop()` command in
`timestep_stochastic_birth_death()` to stop running code when the numbers you 
put in are impossible:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if ((effective.birth.rate >= 1) || (effective.death.rate >= 1))
  stop("Effective rate too high, timestep must be too big")
```

Rerun the code and check it stops when appropriate.

## Check it works

As with previous exercises, you need to check that everything works correctly --
that the package installs, and the demos and help files work and you can
generate reports from the demos -- and then we want you to get a couple of other
people in your breakout room to check your code and make sure it works for them,
and we want you to check other people's code too. We describe how to do this for
packages in GitHub in Practical 3-1 (also under *Check it works*) if you're
uncertain.

*Remember, interacting like this through GitHub to help each other will count as
most of your engagement marks for the course.*
