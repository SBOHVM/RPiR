## Overview

In this practical you will see how we can make the code for the stochastic
birth-death model safer, simpler, and more reusable.

## Background

When running stochastic simulations we often want to run multiple simulations
and compare outputs easily. In this practical we will learn how to efficiently 
plot multiple outputs on the same graph, and use a new set of functions 
contained within the 
<span style="color: #1697C0;">SBOHVM/RPiR</span> package on GitHub.

## Tasks

In the previous practical your script repeated a section of code to overlay 
multiple outputs on the same plot. We recommended that you use a `for` loop to 
solve this problem, since *copying and pasting identical code is bad practice* 
and can easily introduce mistakes. In this practical, we're going to attempt
to improve our code further by separating the simulation functionality from the 
model more cleanly. 

### Look at `run_simple()`

Take a look at the new function `run_simple()` online. Go to 
<span style="color: #1697C0;">https://github.com/SBOHVM/RPiR</span>, open on the 
<span style="color: #1697C0;">R</span> folder, and find the file called 
<span style="color: #1697C0;">run_simple.R</span>. It should look something like
this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#' @title Simplest code to run a simulation loop 
#'
#' @description
#' A generic function to run a simulation loop for a fixed period of time.
#'
#' @param step_function Function to run a timestep (step_function())
#' which returns a list containing elements updated.pop} with the
#' updated population and end.experiment which is TRUE if
#' the experiment has ended (FALSE if not)
#' @param initial.pop Initial population data frame with columns corresponding 
#' to function requirements
#' @param end.time End of time simulation
#' @param ... (optional) any other arguments for step_function(), e.g. 
#' parameters or timestep
#'
#' @return Data frame containing population history of simulation over time
run_simple <- function(step_function, 
                       initial.pop,
                       end.time, 
                       ...) {
  # Check whether step_function uses global variables
  if (length(findGlobals(step_function, merge = FALSE)$variables) > 0)
    warning(paste("Function provided uses global variable(s):",
                  paste(findGlobals(step_function, merge = FALSE)$variables,
                        collapse = ", "))) 
  population.df <- latest.df <- initial.pop 
  keep.going <- (latest.df$time < end.time)
  while (keep.going) {
    data <- step_function(latest.df, ...)
    latest.df <- data$updated.pop
    population.df <- rbind(population.df, latest.df) 
    keep.going <- (latest.df$time < end.time) && (!data$end.experiment)
  }
  row.names(population.df) <- NULL 
  population.df
}
```

The purpose of this new function is to separate out the simulation functionality 
from the model, and to simplify and automate the running of multiple stochastic
simulations. If you look closely you can see that the function `run_simple()` 
does the job we described in the previous practical. It is set up in terms 
of the generically named `step_function` argument, which in the case of the 
current model would be the `timestep_stochastic_birth_death()` function. Note 
however, that `step_function` requires the function name without brackets since 
here we are passing the function itself, rather than calling it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
final.populations <- run_simple(timestep_stochastic_birth_death,
                                initial.populations, 
                                end.time,
                                birth.rate = some.specific.birth.rate,
                                death.rate = some.specific.death.rate,
                                timestep = short.timestep)
```

There are two things going on here that we haven't seen before: (1) We're 
passing the step function as an argument to the `run_simple()` function. This 
just happens like any other argument being passed, you pass in the function, it 
gets assigned to the `step_function` argument -- remember that we can call it 
anything inside a function -- and then `step_function` gets used just like
`initial.pop` and all of the other arguments. (2) the argument `...`. 
This is a way of saying "and there will be other arguments I don't want to (or 
can't) specify". You will find this in lots of R code (see `?plot` for example). 
For us, the point is that *each step function will need different parameters* 
*passed to it, and we don't know what they are in advance*. Instead we just pass 
them through:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data <- step_function(initial.pop, ...)
```

> Any arguments after the three fixed arguments of `run_simple()`
*must be named* -- since they will be *blindly* passed straight through to the 
step function (via the `...`).

### Write a demo

Now write a new demo called 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">d0303_run_birth_death</span> using
`run_simple()` to replace the whole simulation loop in the earlier code. 
This should make the code in
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">d0302_stochastic_birth_death</span> more compact, 
and will also make it much less prone to error, as we've isolated 10 more lines 
of code that we never need to write (or copy and paste) again. 

If you encounter any problems, `RPiR` has a function, `run_simulation()`, 
that does some additional checking and reporting if you set an additional 
argument `debug = TRUE`, which may help you identify what's going wrong. We've 
mostly suggested using `run_simple()` here as it's significantly easier to 
follow what's going on in the function, but in future exercises, it's better to 
use `run_simulation()` for everything as it has some other additional 
functionality.

## Report

### 1. Compare stochastic and deterministic models

Run the stochastic birth death model with a birth rate of 0.06, a death rate of 
0.02, an initial population count of 1, and a timestep of 1. Observe the 
variability in the outputs. Overlay the deterministic model results on the same 
plot. **Note that you can't use the `run_simple()` or `run_simulation()` function with the old `step_deterministic_birth_death()` step function because it doesn't know about the `time` column in the data frame or timesteps, so you just need to copy the `for ()` loop from the `d0105...` demo to get the deterministic result.** You should get something like this:

<center>![plot](images/3-3.png)</center>

### 2. Increase the initial population size

What happens to the variability as you increase the initial population size? 
You may want to adjust the scale of the y-axis to see what happens at larger 
population sizes. To automate this, you can set the y-axis upper limit to 
$100 \times$ `initial.count` by setting `ylim = c(0, 100 * initial.count)`. 
Report these results in your demo.

## Check it works

As with previous exercises, you need to check that everything works correctly --
that the package installs, and the demos and help files work and you can
generate reports from the demos -- and then we want you to get a couple of other
people in your subgroup to check your code and make sure it works for them,
and we want you to check other people's code too. We describe how to do this for
packages in GitHub in Practical 3-1 (also under *Check it works*) if you're
uncertain.

*Remember, interacting like this through GitHub to help each other will count as
most of your engagement marks for the course.*
