## Overview

*In this session we will start to think ahead about what kind of framework we will need when we move on to more complex models. We will build this framework (using data frames) in the context of our existing exponential growth model, and we will separate out another potentially complex element of the code -- the plotting function -- where we can refine it separately from the functionally important simulation code.*

## Background

Our current model of growth of a population is held in the function 
`step_simple_growth()`, which has only one parameter (`growth.rate`) and one 
group of individuals (`current.population`). You could easily consider the 
amount of code and commenting that has gone into updating the latter with the 
former overkill.

However, we are developing this code knowing that we are going to be moving on 
to significantly more complex models with multiple parameters (*e.g.* infection 
rate, recovery rate), and multiple groups (*e.g.* susceptible and infected 
individuals), more complex ways of updating the population structure (of which 
more later), and more sophisticated ways of displaying the results.

With that in mind we are going to see how to make some of the structures in the 
code more general by introducing **data frames**, which are just R's way of 
representing a table of data. Although the advantages of this are somewhat 
limited at the moment, they will be hopefully be clear when we move on to the 
epidemiological models.

## Tasks

The task for this practical is to replace the vector `population.vector` with a 
one-column **data frame** named `population.df` with column name `count`. We 
want to end up with a population update function 
(which we have now called `step_deterministic_growth()` for consistency with 
later programs) that takes in a data frame containing the current population 
count and the `growth.rate` parameter and outputs a data frame containing the 
updated count. Rewrite the code throughout so that it uses a data frame instead 
of a vector -- we have called these files 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-run-growth.R</span> and 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-step-growth.R</span>. Remember to 
use `data.frame()` to create a data frame and `rbind()` to append one onto 
another. 

So that we don't need to worry about how to plot the outputs, we have provided a 
function called `plot_populations()` in the `RPiR` package which will take a 
data frame with any number of population columns and a single corresponding 
`time` column and plot them together in different colours with a legend 
indicating which line corresponds to which population. The RPiR package contains
the function, so you will need to call `library(RPiR)` to load it. In order to
use it you will need to add a column called  `time` into your data frame with
the times in it and then call:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_populations(population.df)
```

We will therefore be breaking the code into three sections <span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-run-growth.R</span>, 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-step-growth.R</span> and the RPiR package
which handle the mechanics, the model and the display respectively. 

We'll start by working on the function, then go on to change the main script later.

#### Changes needed to update 0103-step-simple-growth.R to 0104-step-growth.R

We've generated <span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-step-growth.R</span> (from <span style="color: #dd1c77;">0103-step-simple-growth.R</span>) for you to edit:

```{r step_deterministic_growth, exercise = TRUE, exercise.cap = "0104-step-growth.R", exercise.lines = 18}
#' ### Function: step_simple_growth() 
#' Run one step of a simple deterministic exponential growth model. 
#'
#' Arguments: 
#' - current.population -- the population count now
#' - growth.rate -- the growth rate 
#'
#' Returns:
#' - the updated population count
#'
step_simple_growth <- function(current.population, growth.rate) {
  # Calculate changes to population
  new.additions <- growth.rate * current.population
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.population <- current.population + new.additions
  # Return updated population
  next.population
}
```  

<div id="step_deterministic_growth-hint">
**Hint:** See the text below for details of how to do this. 
</div>

```{r step_deterministic_growth-solution}
#' ### Function: step_deterministic_growth() 
#' Run one step of a simple deterministic exponential growth model. 
#'
#' Arguments: 
#' - latest -- the population count now
#' - growth.rate -- the growth rate 
#'
#' Returns:
#' - the updated population count
#'
step_deterministic_growth <- function(latest, growth.rate) {
  # Calculate changes to population
  new.additions <- growth.rate * latest$count 
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  next.count <- latest$count + new.additions
  # Create a data frame with the updated counts and return it
  data.frame(count = next.count) 
}
```

```{r step_deterministic_growth-check}
grade_this_code()
```

<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-step-growth.R</span> should contain the 
function doing the work in the simulation, `step_deterministic_growth()`, but 
with a few improvements to work in terms of a data frame rather than just a 
vector. So the first thing to do is change the name of the function.

Next, we'll rename the argument `current.population` to `latest`, being suitably 
generic to work in all future models even if they are not about population 
dynamics.

We are now allowing the populations that are handled within this function to 
potentially contain several columns corresponding to different sets of 
individuals. Thus, `latest` is a data frame that contains a single row
containing the latest population size for each of the component populations -- in 
this case just the one, `count`. Therefore, to perform the update step we need 
to extract the actual population we are interested in. For this we use the `$` expression:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new.additions <- growth.rate * latest$count 
```

In general if we have a data frame called `my.frame` then `my.frame$first.col` 
will give us the column called `first.col`. So in our example (although we only 
have one column) we want to extract the column called count from the data frame
called latest with the expression `latest$count` and use its value for the 
update step.

Finally, the function should return a data frame, like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data.frame(count = next.count) 
```

which will be assigned to whatever variable in the main script we choose, in 
this case `updated.population`.

#### Changes needed to update 0103-run-simple-growth.R to 0104-run-growth.R

For convenience, we've generated 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-run-growth.R</span> (from 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0103-run-simple-growth.R</span>) for you to edit. 
Note that, as before, `source()`
has been commented out as it won't work in the `learnr` environment. Instead, 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0103-step-simple-growth-function.R</span> and 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-step-growth.R</span> have been preloaded for
you:

```{r step_simple_growth-setup}
library(RPiR)

step_simple_growth <- function(current.population, growth.rate) {
  new.additions <- growth.rate * current.population
  next.population <- current.population + new.additions
  next.population
}
  
step_deterministic_growth <- function(latest, growth.rate) {
  new.additions <- growth.rate * latest$count 
  next.count <- latest$count + new.additions
  data.frame(count = next.count) 
}
```

```{r step_simple_growth, exercise = TRUE, exercise.cap = "0104-run-growth.R", exercise.lines = 44}
# Load the step_simple_growth() function into the global environment (my workspace)
# Note this next line would be needed if you were running this in RStudio
# source("0103-step-simple-growth-function.R")

#' Set up the simulation parameters
#' --------------------------------
#' First we set up the parameters for the simulation.

# Set the growth rate
human.annual.growth <- 0.015

# Starting population size
initial.count <- 7000000000

# And setting times
start.time <- 0
end.time <- 100

#' Run the simplest possible simulation
#' ------------------------------------
#' Then run it so that we can get the output we need

# Set up the population starting size (at the first timestep)
population.vector <- initial.count

# The timesteps that the simulation will run through
timesteps <- seq(from = start.time + 1, to = end.time)

# Now we loop through the time itself (starting at the second timestep)
for (new.time in timesteps) {
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  updated.human.population <- step_simple_growth(current.population = tail(population.vector, 1), 
                                                 growth.rate = human.annual.growth)
  # Add new element onto end of population vector
  population.vector <- c(population.vector, updated.human.population)
}

#' Plot the results
#' ----------------
#' And finally we output the results.

# Now we can plot the timesteps against the population vector
plot(c(start.time, timesteps), population.vector, type = "l")
```

```{r step_simple_growth-solution}
library(RPiR)
# Load the step_simple_growth() function into the global environment (my workspace)
# Note this next line would be needed if you were running this in RStudio
# source("0104-step-growth.R")

#' Set up the simulation parameters
#' --------------------------------
#' First we set up the parameters for the simulation.

# Set the growth rate
human.annual.growth <- 0.015

# Starting population size
initial.count <- 7000000000

# And setting times
start.time <- 0
end.time <- 100

#' Run the simplest possible simulation
#' ------------------------------------
#' Then run it so that we can get the output we need

# Set up the population starting size (at the first timestep)
population.df <- data.frame(count = initial.count)

# The timesteps that the simulation will run through
timesteps <- seq(from = start.time + 1, to = end.time)

# Now we loop through the time itself (starting at the second timestep)
for (new.time in timesteps) {
  # Calculate population at next timestep
  updated.population <- step_deterministic_growth(latest = tail(population.df, 1),
                                                  growth.rate = human.annual.growth) 
  # Add new element onto end of population vector
  population.df <- rbind(population.df, updated.population)
}

#' Plot the results
#' ----------------
#' And finally we output the results.

# Now we can plot the timesteps against the population vector
population.df$time <- c(start.time, timesteps)
plot_populations(population.df)
```

```{r step_simple_growth-check}
grade_this_code()
```

At the beginning of the file, we should load the `RPiR` package, because we're going to 
be using the `plot_populations()` function that it provides, so add that in first:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(RPiR)
```

Then read in function from the new file (though since we're working in
the `learnr` environment rather than RStudio you should comment this line out,
since the file has been preloaded for you):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("0104-step-growth.R")
```

With that done, the biggest change throughout
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-run-growth.R</span> (and 
<span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-step-growth.R</span>) is that the population
is now defined in terms of a data frame rather than as a vector. So setting it
up will happen like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
population.df <- data.frame(count = initial.count)
```

A data frame is just R's ways of referring to a table of data, so whereas our 
vector approach in the previous code would allow us to have a single list of 
values, the data frame will allow us to have several columns of data. Whilst 
this isn't necessary for this piece of code the approach will be very useful 
when we are handling multiple populations (for example susceptible, infected and
recovered individuals in an epidemiological model).

Now we want to send the latest row of the data frame to the function 
`step_deterministic_growth()`, which we will define below. It turns out we do 
that exactly the same way (using `tail()`) as we did with vectors. Notice that 
we have changed the name of the first parameter to something generic which will 
work in all future models even if they are not about population dynamics.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
updated.population <- step_deterministic_growth(latest = tail(population.df, 1),
                                                growth.rate = human.annual.growth) 
population.df <- rbind(population.df, updated.population)
```

The second line is slightly different, however. `rbind()` binds -- appends -- the 
rows of a second data frame (`updated.population`) after the end of the last row of the first data 
frame (`population.df`). The two data frames must have the same columns for this to work, or they
wouldn't fit: in this case they will both have to have one column called 
`count`, so our function will need to return a data frame with just that column 
in it when we write it below. You will get a clearer idea of how the data frames 
work once we start on the epidemiological models with multiple populations, so 
don't worry if it isn't currently clear.

At the end of your new <span style="color: #dd1c77;">0104-run-growth.R</span> file,
rather than use R's basic plot command plot as we did previously, we have now
used a function `plot_populations()`, which is defined
inside the `RPiR` library. The job of 
this function is to take a data frame with any number of population columns and 
a single corresponding `time` column and plot them together in different colours 
with a legend indicating which line corresponds to which population. It will
allow us to ignore the plotting details for the moment.

In order to use it you will first need to delete the current `plot()` command at 
the end of your new file, and instead add a column onto 
your data frame with the times in and use `plot_populations()` on this updated 
data frame. As the `timesteps` vector is missing the start time of the 
simulation, the column you need to add to the data frame is actually
`c(start.time, timesteps)`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
population.df$time <- c(start.time, timesteps)
```

Then you will call:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_populations(population.df)
```

#### Additional tasks

Again, the code should produce the same output as the previous three practicals, 
but perhaps with a slightly prettier and clearer display. Try, for instance,
generating a second result with different initial parameters and then plot the
results using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_populations(population.df, new.graph = FALSE, col = "red")
```

The extra argument `col` sets the colour of the line in the plot -- "red", 
"blue", etc.; or you could use `lty` to set the type of line -- solid, 
dash, dot, etc. -- by using numbers (1 is solid, 2, 3, *etc.*). Note that
`plot_populations()` also has a help file, which you can access by typing
`?plot_populations`:

```{r plotpopulations-setup}
library(RPiR)
```

```{r plotpopulations, exercise = TRUE}
?plot_populations
```

This documentation is available, since `plot_populations()` was installed as 
part of {RPiR}. When functions are loaded using `source()`, rather than being 
installed, then the only documentation is that in the file itself. 
Occasionally, you might come across a function that won't let you ask for help 
using the `?` syntax -- `?for`, `?function` and a couple of others. In that case 
you can use the `help()` function instead.

```{r function_help, exercise = TRUE}
# Access the help for the "function" command

```

<div id="function_help-hint">
**Hint:** Try using `help("___")`. 
</div>

```{r function_help-solution}
help("function")
```

```{r function_help-check}
grade_this_code()
```

or go to the <span style="color: #dd1c77;">Help</span> tab in RStudio and type 
the name into the box next to the magnifying glass. 

As far as the `plot_populations()` function is concerned, feel free to refer 
back to this code later to understand better how it works by finding the code on
GitHub. Or you can just run the name of the function on its own at an R prompt.
We made a simpler (but less powerful) version of the plot
function - `plot_simple()` - that you may find easier to read:

```{r plot_simple, exercise = TRUE}
library(RPiR)
plot_simple
```

Many of the helper functions in the course are fairly 
sophisticated and you will probably have to take on trust for the time being.
We will be providing these functions as we go along to allow you to focus on the
models being developed -- you are welcome to use them yourselves later, but if 
you use them for real you should spend some time satisfying yourself that they 
really do what you want.
