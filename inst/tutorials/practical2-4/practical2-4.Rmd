## Overview

*In this practical we will take our SIS model and extend it to produce the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered or SIR model. In this instance we'll use the parameters for foot-and- mouth disease, a highly infectious disease of ruminants -- in this case cattle.*

## Background

The SIR model in difference equation form is given by the following equations:

$$S(t+1) = S(t) - \beta \times \frac{S(t) \times I(t)}{N}$$
$$I(t+1) = I(t) + \beta \times \frac{S(t) \times I(t)}{N} - \sigma \times I(t)$$
$$R(t+1) = R(t) + \sigma \times I(t)$$

## Tasks

Your task is to copy and edit the files from the previous practical 
(<span style="color: #de77ae;">0204-deterministic-SIS.R</span> and 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">0204-run-SIS.R</span>) to produce
the corresponding files 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">0205-deterministic-SIR.R</span> and 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">0205-run-SIR.R</span> that 
run the SIR model rather than the SIS model. There shouldn't be too many changes 
that are necessary, though obviously the first is to add a new population (the
**recovereds**) to the data frame and remember than $N$, the total population size, 
now includes the recovereds too. Also remember that if you change the name of 
the function, for example from `timestep_deterministic_SIS()` to
`timestep_deterministic_SIR()` you need to change it in both files. 

Because
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is so transmissible that the disease flashes 
through a herd very quickly, to model it we normally deal with farms rather than
individual animals when we are thinking about transmission and recovery, so an
"individual" is actually a farm in the model. This makes no difference to your 
code, but may change your choice of some variable names. You'll therefore need 
to know the transmission and recovery rates of farms, and very roughly, running 
in timesteps of weeks again, we can use a transmission rate of 2 and a recovery
rate of 1/2. Note that with such high transmission and recovery rates, you'll 
find the outbreak finishes very quickly, so you should find that the end time of
the simulation can be quite short, and you should find that the timestep will 
have to be below 1 to be stable.

## Running the code

Run the code by running your new file <span style="color: #de77ae;">0205-run-SIR.R</span>.
Check that you get the same results as you saw in the lecture for an $R_0$ of 2.
Adding the argument `col=c("green", "red", "black")` to `plot_populations()`
will allow you to change the colours of the plot to match those from the lecture.

## Report

Create a report showing farm-to-farm transmission of FMD, displaying the output
of its SIR model in a figure. You could for instance show how that differs 
from an SIS model with the same $R_0$, or another SIR model with a different
$R_0$.

## GitHub

As with the other exercises, we want you to get a couple of other people to
check your code and make sure it works for them, and we want you to check other
people's code too.

### Getting help with your code

Once you're happy with your code, commit your changes using the Git pane in
RStudio (it's best just to commit the R files for now - not, for instance, any
html files that were created by generating reports). Don't forget then to push
the changes to GitHub and check on the website that it contains your new code.
Notify the partners we have allocated you that you have something for them to
check. You can do this on Zoom, but please also create an issue in your
repository asking for their review - you can contact them by tagging them in
the message with `@theirusername`, and they should receive an email and a
[notification on the website](https://github.com/notifications). They can then
respond to this issue, telling you if they had any problems running your version
of the practical.

### Checking other people's code

Likewise, when you hear from someone else that a repo is available to check,
then if it's a project you have already downloaded, you should open that
project in RStudio, go to the Git pane, and click on the **Pull** button to
get the updates they have pushed to GitHub (there should be a subtle message
saying that updates are available near the button). If you're checking a new
person's work, or a new project, refer to the instructions in Practical 2-2.
Once you've checked that the new code has downloaded, you can then run their
code and make sure it works. If it does not, just respond in the Issue that they
opened on GitHub explaining what went wrong (it might help to also do
this in person on Zoom if they are there). If it works, then you also need
to respond saying so.

Interacting like this through GitHub to help each other will count as most of
your engagement marks for the course.
