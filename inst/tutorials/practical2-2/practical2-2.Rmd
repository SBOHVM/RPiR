## Overview

*In this practical we will examine the effect of changing the time step on the
model outputs. Remember that in the lecture we said that we increase the
accuracy of simulations when we use small time steps, and we reduce the
accuracy (but speed up the simulation) when we use large time steps.*

## Background

So far, we have written code to model difference equations, where events happen
at fixed intervals. For some biological populations such as insects reproducing
on an annual cycle this framework is very appropriate. However, in general we
are interested in events that could happen at any point, and importantly once an
event has happened it can affect the rate at which new events happen -- for
instance, when the first infected animal in a large population succeeds in 
infecting a second, the rate of infection approximately doubles. If we use large
time steps we may miss this effect of changing transmission rates between one 
time step and the next, whereas if we use very small timesteps, we will be
accurate but many steps will contain no events, thus wasting computational time.
In this practical we will see that the size of the time step affects our model.

## Tasks

To change the model to handle timesteps, we have to consider that by 
default, in the previous programs we were using a timestep of 1. In this case -- 
of *E. coli* transmission in cattle from Practical 2-2 -- these are measured in 
weeks, which means that if our rates were given to us in units of weeks, then we
are stepping forward one week at a time. If our rates were given to us per day 
rather than per week we would be stepping forward day by day. If a rate is given 
to us in weeks, we could scale it down accordingly to get the rate per day. Or,
we could scale it up to get the rate per month. So to change our program to step
forward on a different time scale, we scale the parameters. Our parameters (the
transmission and recovery rates) will help us determine the number of 
transmissions and recoveries that occur in one unit of time. To simulate
stepping forward in larger of smaller amounts of time we scale the parameters by
the new time step.

The task now is edit <span style="color: #de77ae;">0202-run-SIS.R</span> so that
it is easy to alter the timestep of the simulation -- you can reuse
`step_deterministic_SIS()`. All you need to do is to write a new script file
which creates a new parameter, `timestep`, so that you can scale
`transmission.rate` and `recovery.rate` to  `ecoli.transmission * timestep` and
`ecoli.recovery * timestep` before passing  them to `step_deterministic_SIS()`.
You also need to remember that the vector of `timesteps` to loop through is now
also wrong. Make sure that you adjust it correctly so that it will give the
correct times for the plot. You can check it has by looking at
`population.df$time` after you've added it in to the data frame and make sure it
looks right to you. We can call this new version <span style="color: #de77ae;">
0203-test-SIS.R</span>.

## Running the code

`timestep` does not need to be a whole number, and it can be less than 1. Start 
running your programming with a `timestep` of 1, and then try reducing it to 0.1 
and then compare your outputs. If they appear unchanged it means the first 
timestep was small enough to produce an accurate output. Remember you can plot
multiple graphs on top of each other to make it easier to directly compare 
timesteps.

Once you've satisfied yourself that the simulation is currently accurate, find 
out by how much you can increase the timestep safely before the simulation 
becomes inaccurate. Running this code with a `timestep` of 3 or 5 means that we
are stepping forward in chunks of time that are 3 or 5 times larger than our 
default time step. Note that if you don't use the parameters from *E. coli*
transmission in cattle, the values of the timestep at which is all goes wrong 
may be different, so we recommend sticking with those values.

## Report

Demonstrate the instabilities at high timesteps in a report, with some text 
explaining when things break down and the simulation is no longer reliable, and 
when, conversely, there is no advantage to reducing the timesteps further.

## GitHub

As with the other exercises, we want you to get a couple of other people to
check your code and make sure it works for them, and we want you to check other
people's code too.

### Getting help with your code

Once you're happy with your code, commit your changes using the Git pane in
RStudio (it's best just to commit the R files for now - not, for instance, any
html files that were created by generating reports). Don't forget then to push
the changes to GitHub and check on the website that it contains your new code.
Notify the partners we have allocated you that you have something for them to
check. You can do this on Zoom, but please also create an issue in your
repository asking for their review - you can contact them by tagging them in
the message with `@theirusername`, and they should receive an email and a
[notification on the website](https://github.com/notifications). They can then
respond to this issue, telling you if they had any problems running your version
of the practical.

### Checking other people's code

Likewise, when you hear from someone else that a repo is available to check,
then if it's a project you have already downloaded, you should open that
project in RStudio, go to the Git pane, and click on the **Pull** button to
get the updates they have pushed to GitHub (there should be a subtle message
saying that updates are available near the button). If you're checking a new
person's work, or a new project, refer to the instructions in Practical 2-2.
Once you've checked that the new code has downloaded, you can then run their
code and make sure it works. If it does not, just respond in the Issue that they
opened on GitHub explaining what went wrong (it might help to also do
this in person on Zoom if they are there). If it works, then you also need
to respond saying so.

Interacting like this through GitHub to help each other will count as most of
your engagement marks for the course.
