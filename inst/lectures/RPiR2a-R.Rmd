# What's different about R?

## What's different about R? {.build}

- Formulae and factors
- Data frames
- Subsetting data
- Plotting data and generating reports and saving them to disk
- Massive database of user-supplied packages
- Specialised Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  - RStudio
- Trivial to create your own packages
  - Integration with GitHub

## What are formulae?

- Formulae!
- Compact symbolic form for storing formulae for model building
```{R}
?formula
```

## What are factors?

- Vectors
  - but for data in a fixed number of categories, possibly ordered
- Compact form for storing categorical data for model building

```{R}
?factor
?ordered
?levels
```

## What are data frames? {.smaller}

- Tables (as from a spreadsheet)
  - One or more rows of data
  - Named columns of fixed type
- Fundamental data structure for most modelling functions

```{R}
head(mtcars)
```

```{R, eval = FALSE}
?data.frame
?read.csv
?read.table
```

## How do we subset vectors?

```{R}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3)
vec[vec > 2]
```

```{R}
vec <- 1:3
vec > 2
```

```{R}
vec <- seq(from = 1, to = 3)
subs <- c(T, F, T)
vec[subs]
```

## How do we subset data frames?

```{R}
df <- data.frame(val = c(1, 2, 3),
                 other = c("a", "b", "a"))
df$other
```

```{R}
df[df$other == "b", ]
```

```{R}
subset(df, val == 1)
```

## How do we subset data frames?

But these things are constantly evolving:
```{R, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
df %>% filter(other == "b")
```

```{R}
mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 20) %>% filter(carb >= 4)
```

## How do we plot?

```{R}
plot(c(1, 2, 3), c(1, 2, 1))
lines(c(1, 2, 3), c(2, 1, 2))
```

## How do we plot? {.smaller}

Again, there are much more sophisticated ways, as you know... *e.g.*
```{R, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

## How do we save to disk?

```{R, eval = FALSE}
png("out.png")
plot(c(1, 2, 3), c(1, 2, 1), type = "l")
dev.off()
```

```{R, eval = FALSE}
?pdf
?png
?Devices
```

## How do we save to disk? 

Again, using ggplot2...
```{R, eval = FALSE}
g <- mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggsave("out.png", g)
```

```{R, eval = FALSE}
?ggsave
```

## How do we use packages?

Install it first:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tibble"))
```

or from RStudio menus, and then use it:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

not forgetting:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
update.packages()
```

occasionally.

## So how do you learn to program?

## What do you want to do?

- Access data
- Build models
- Test hypotheses
- Run analyses
- Report the results
- Share the results and the techniques with others

## What are you going to do?

Learn how to:

> - Write code
> - Write documentation
>   - So you can come back and understand it later
> - Identify and isolate reusable code
>   - So you don’t have to write it again later
> - Generate documented results
> - Read and understand other people's code

## What are you going to do?

> - Read and write well-documented and well-structured code
> - Use this to generate clear and well-documented results/reports

## How are you going to do it?

> - Problems will be structured around population dynamics, epidemiology and biodiversity
> - They will start off easy and ramp up
> - Packages (libraries) will allow you to solve many problems easily, but we are
    focusing on problems they don’t help with!
