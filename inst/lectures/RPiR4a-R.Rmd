# Some useful things...

## Important functionality {.smaller}

-   Loading files using `source(...)`
-   Vectors, `c()`, `seq()`, `head()` and `tail()`
-   for loops:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
    for (...) { ... }
```

-   functions:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
    my_fun <- function() { ... }
```

-   if statements

```{R, eval=FALSE}
    if (...) { ... } else { ... }
```

-   Using curly brackets `{ ... }`
-   (joining) data frames

```{R, eval=FALSE}
    data.frame(...)
    rbind(df1, df2)
```

## Loading files

```{R, eval=FALSE}
    source("0105-step-birth-death.R")
    step_deterministic_birth_death
```

```{R, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
    source(system.file("dummy_project/0105-step-birth-death.R", package = "RPiR"))
    step_deterministic_birth_death
```

## Vectors

```{R, comment=""}
c("Hello", "Goodbye")
```

```{R, comment=""}
words <- c("Welcome", "Farewell")
words[2]
```

## `seq()`

```{R, comment=""}
seq(2, 4)
```

```{R, comment=""}
wholes <- seq(from = 3, to = 6)
wholes
```

```{R, comment=""}
halves <- seq(from = 3, to = 7, by = 0.5)
halves
```

## `head()` and `tail()`

```{R, comment=""}
head(halves)
```

```{R, comment=""}
tail(halves, 1)
```

## `for (...)` loops

```{R, eval=FALSE}
for (item in vector) {
  do something, probably to item
}
```

Remember, `wholes` was `seq(from = 3, to = 6)`:

```{R, comment=""}
for (whole in wholes) {
  print(whole)
}
```

## `for (...)` loops

```{R, comment=""}
halves <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.5)
total <- 0
for (half in halves) {
  print(half)
  total <- total + half
}
total
```

## Functions

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  first + second
}
add_up(3, 5)
```

## Functions

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  result <- first + second
}
add_up(3, 5)
```

## Functions

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  result <- first + second
  result
}
add_up(3, 5)
```

## Functions

```{R, comment=""}
### <b>
add_up <- function(first, second) {
### </b>
  result <- first + second
### <b>
  second - first
}
add_up(3, 5) ### </b>
```

## Functions

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  # Calculate the result
  result <- first + second
  # And return it
### <b>
  result
### </b>
}
add_up(3, 5)
```

## Functions

We want to calculate: $$(first + second) \times (first + second)$$

```{R, comment=""}
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  # Calculate the result
  added <- first + second
  squared <- added * added
  # And return it
  squared
}
add_and_square(3, 5)
```

## Functions

Doing it all in one go increases the risk of mistakes:

```{R, comment=""}
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  (first + second) * first + second
}
add_and_square(3, 5)
```

## `if (...) {...}` statements

If statements allow us to do different things depending on what has gone before in the code.

## `if (...) {...}` statements

```{R, comment=""}
if (add_and_square(3, 5) == 64) {
  print("Maths still works")
}
```

## `if (...) {...} else {...}`

```{R, comment=""}
if (add_and_square(3, 5) == 64) {
  print("Maths still works")
} else {
  warning("We have a problem")
  print(add_and_square(3, 5))
}
```

## `if (...) {...} else {...}`

```{R, comment=""}
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  # Calculate the result
  added <- first + second
  squared <- added * added
  # And return it
  squared
}
```

## `if (...) {...} else {...}`

```{R, comment=""}
if (add_and_square(3, 5) == 64) {
  usethis::ui_done("Maths still works")
} else {
  usethis::ui_oops("We have a problem")
}
```

## Using curly brackets `{ ... }`

Curly brackets allow us to do lots of things all in one go. You've seen them in for loops, if statements, function definitions. They turn multiple R statements into one block, like a code block in RMarkdown but in regular R. Make sure you don't forget them.

## Using curly brackets `{ ... }`

```{R, echo=FALSE}
added <- 0
```

```{R, comment=""}
add_and_square <- function(first, second)
  added <- first + second
  squared <- added * added
  squared

add_and_square(3, 5)
```

## Using curly brackets `{ ... }`

```{R, comment=""}
added <- 0
add_and_square <- function(first, second)
  added <- first + second

squared <- added * added
squared

add_and_square(3, 5)
```

## Using curly brackets `{ ... }`

```{R, comment=""}
added <- 0
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  added <- first + second
}
squared <- added * added
squared

add_and_square(3, 5)
```

## Using curly brackets `{ ... }`

```{R, comment=""}
added <- 0
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  added <- first + second
  squared <- added * added
  squared
}
add_and_square(3, 5)
```

## Using curly brackets `{ ... }`

Notice that they actually interfere with RMarkdown

```{R}
#' ## Adding a header here works!
added <- 0
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  #' ## Adding a header here doesn't work :(
  added <- first + second
  squared <- added * added
  squared
}
```

## (joining) data frames {.smaller}

```{R, comment=""}
first <- head(airquality)
first
```

```{R, comment=""}
class(first)
```

```{R, comment=""}
last <- tail(airquality, 1)
last
```

## (joining) data frames {.smaller}

```{R, comment=""}
full <- rbind(first, last)
full
```

```{R, comment=""}
nrow(full)
```

## Final comments

```{R, eval=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```
This clears the environment, but so does generating a report, and `rm()` can
accidentally delete useful things if itâ€™s used in the wrong place, so *never
use it*. If you have to clear the environment, you can clear the environment
manually using *Session->Clear Workspace*, the brush in the Environment tab, or
even better use *Session->Restart R* to restart everything. Next:
```{R, eval=FALSE}
setwd("c/d") # and more importantly
setwd("c:\a\b\c\d")
```
This will set the working directory to a fixed place, which is very annoying
if you ever move your code or more importantly if someone else tries to use it.
Much better to use a Project, so please *never put `setwd()` into your code
anywhere*.

## Final comments

And finally:
```{R, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tibble")
devtools::install_github("IBAHCM/RPiR")
```
This should be done before you run your code (and later we'll show you how
to make sure it is done as your code is downloaded), but your scripts should
not try to install packages themselves. It's enough that loading the library
will fail if the code is run. It's obvious what to do next if that happens.
