# Plan for today

## Get everything installed

All of the course preparation instructions are in the course's documentation at
https://sbohvm.github.io/RPiR under **Course preparation**. The same page is
also duplicated on the package's GitHub page at https://github.com/SBOHVM/RPiR:

- First follow the instructions there to make sure you have an up-to-date version
of R and RStudio.
- Then follow the links following on from there to pages that tell you how to
install the course itself and create the necessary accounts.

## Read the other materials

Moodle has some links to other materials to read or watch when you finish
installing everything.
