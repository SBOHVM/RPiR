# Loops, functions and flow control {.smaller}

## Useful commands

-   For and while loops:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
    for (...) { ... }
    while (...) { ... }
```

-   Functions:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
    my_fun <- function() { ... }
```

-   Comparisons and Tests
-   If statements

```{R, eval=FALSE}
    if (...) { ... } else { ... }
```

## `for (...)` loops

Runs a block of code *for* a fixed number of times:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
for (item in vector) {
  # Do something, probably to item
}
```

Remember code blocks are the code within a set of curly brackets -- `{ ... }` --
or a single line of code if there are no brackets.

## `for (...)` loops

Runs a block of code  *for* a fixed number of times:

```{R, comment=""}
whole.numbers <- seq(from = 3, to = 6)
for (num in whole.numbers) {
  print(num^2)
}
```

Here, we print out four numbers -- the squares of the numbers in the
`whole.numbers` vector -- because that's how long the vector is.

## `for (...)` loops

Runs a block of code *for* a fixed number of times:

```{R, comment=""}
halves <- seq(from = 1, to = 2, by = 0.5); total <- 0
for (half in halves) {
  total <- total + half
  cat("Adding", half, "gives us", total, "\n")
}
total
```

This updates `total` with the running total and prints it out.

## `while (...)` loops {.smaller}

This runs a block of code *while* a condition is true:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
while (condition.is.TRUE) {
  # Do something that will (or may) update condition
}
```

## `while (...)` loops {.smaller}

This runs a block of code *while* a condition is true:

```{R, comment=""}
half <- 1; increment <- 0.5; total <- 0
while (half <= 2) {
  total <- total + half
  cat("Adding", half, "gives us", total, "\n")
  half <- half + increment
}
total
```

We can produce the same result as a `for` loop with a bit of work.

## `while (...)` loops {.smaller}

This runs a block of code *while* a condition is true:

```{R, comment=""}
half <- 1; increment <- 0.5; total <- 0
while (total < 10) {
  total <- total + half
  cat("Adding", half, "gives us", total, "\n")
  half <- half + increment
}
half
```

But we can have more complex stopping conditions -- has the total got to 10,
for instance... but why is `half` 3.5?

## `while (...)` loops {.smaller}

This runs a block of code *while* a condition is true:

```{R, comment=""}
half <- 0.5; increment <- 0.5; total <- 0
while (total < 10) {
  half <- half + increment
  total <- total + half
  cat("Adding", half, "gives us", total, "\n")
}
half
```

But we do have to be careful how we write the code block in the loop.

## Functions

Functions carry out a single fixed task (or *function*!) for you using the
arguments provided:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# Define the function:
function_name <- function(first, second) {
  # Do something to first and second to produce result
  ...
  # Return result
  result
}

# Then in your script, call the function:
function_name(first = 1, second = 2)
```

Here the function is called `function_name()`, and the arguments are `first` and
`second`.

## Functions

Functions carry out a single fixed task for you using the arguments provided:

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  first + second
}
add_up(3, 5)
add_up(first = 3, second = 5)
```

Here this simple function just adds together its two arguments.

## Functions

Functions carry out a single fixed task for you using the arguments provided:

```{R, comment=""}
subtract <- function(value, from) {
  from - value
}
subtract(3, 5)
subtract(from = 3, value = 5)
```

Note that if you name the arguments, then the order doesn't matter!

## Functions

Functions carry out a single fixed task for you using the arguments provided:

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  result <- first + second
}
add_up(3, 5)
```

The last line of code run is what is returned by the function...

## Functions

Functions carry out a single fixed task for you using the arguments provided:

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  result <- first + second
  result
}
add_up(3, 5)
```

The last line of code run is what is returned by the function...

## Functions

Functions carry out a single fixed task for you using the arguments provided:

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  result <- first + second
  result
  cat("The answer is", result, "\n")
}
result <- add_up(3, 5)
result
```

So you need to be careful what is on that last line!

## Functions

Functions carry out a single fixed task for you using the arguments provided:

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  result <- first + second
  return(result)
}
add_up(3, 5)
```

You can explicitly tell the function to end and return a value.

## Functions

Functions carry out a single fixed task for you using the arguments provided:

```{R, comment=""}
add_up <- function(first, second) {
  result <- first + second
  return(result)
  cat("The answer is", result, "\n")
}
result <- add_up(3, 5)
result
```

If you include a `return()` statement the function will end there.

## Functions

We recommend calculating partial results inside functions whenever it is
sensible to make your code easier to read. Imagine we want to calculate:
$$(first + second) \times (first + second)$$

```{R, comment=""}
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  # Calculate the result
  added <- first + second
  squared <- added * added
  # And return it
  squared
}
add_and_square(3, 5)
```

## Functions

Doing it all in one go increases the risk of mistakes:

```{R, comment=""}
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  (first + second) * first + second
}
add_and_square(3, 5)
```

## Comparisons -- testing for equality and difference

Essential for `while` loops and `if` statements. They allow us to test whether
something is true, and change what lines of code are run depending on the
outcome. There are the basic tests:

- `a == b`: is `a` equal to `b`? (`TRUE` if this is true, `FALSE` if this is false)
- `a > b`: is `a` greater than `b`?
- `a < b`: is `a` less than `b`?
- `a >= b`: is `a` greater than or equal to `b`?
- `a <= b`: is `a` less than or equal to `b`?
- `a != b`: is `a` different from `b`?

## Comparisons -- testing for equality and difference

Essential for `while` loops and `if` statements. They allow us to test whether
something is true, and change what lines of code are run depending on the
outcome. There are the basic tests:

- `a == b`: is `a` equal to `b`? (`TRUE` if this is true, `FALSE` if this is false)
- `a > b`: is `a` greater than `b`?
- `a < b`: is `a` less than `b`?
- `a >= b`: is `a` greater than or equal to `b`?
- `a <= b`: is `a` less than or equal to `b`?
- `a != b`: is `a` different from `b`?

## Comparisons -- testing for equality and difference

There are then three basic ways of changing or combining the above:

- `(a < b) || (c == d)`: is **either ** `a` less than `b` **or** `c` equal to `d`?
- `(a < b) && (c == d)`: is **both** `a` less than `b` **and** `c` equal to `d`?
- `!((a < b) && (c == d))`: is the above **not** `TRUE`? `TRUE` if the above was
  `FALSE` and vice versa 

Remember to use brackets to ensure you are combining things in the right
order. They can be used in the `while` loops above to determine whether to
continue through the next iteration of the loop, and in the `if` statements
below to determine what to do next.

## `if (...) {...}` statements

If statements allow us to do different things depending on what has gone before
in the code.

## `if (...) {...}` statements

If statements allow us to do different things depending on what has gone before
in the code:

```{R}
library(codetools)
library(RPiR)

if (length(findGlobals(add_and_square, merge = FALSE)$variables) != 0) {
  stop("Function add_and_square() may not use global variable(s): ",
       findGlobals(add_and_square, merge = FALSE)$variables)
}
```

Here we test if `add_and_square()` has any global variables.

## `if (...) {...}` statements

```{R, comment=""}
if (add_and_square(3, 5) == 64) {
  print("Maths still works")
}
```

## `if (...) {...} else {...}`

```{R, comment=""}
if (add_and_square(3, 5) == 64) {
  print("Maths still works")
} else {
  warning("We have a problem")
  print(add_and_square(3, 5))
}
```

## `if (...) {...} else {...}`

```{R, comment=""}
add_and_square <- function(first, second) {
  # Calculate the result
  added <- first + second
  squared <- added * added
  # And return it
  squared
}
```

## `if (...) {...} else {...}`

```{R, comment=""}
if (add_and_square(3, 5) == 64) {
  cat("Maths still works\n")
} else {
  cat("We have a problem\n")
}
```
